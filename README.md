# Wolman Pebble Counter
Wolman pebble counts are routinely done by researchers and technicians studying or managing streams. This app streamlines this procedure by creating counters for each of the 16 size classes and an additional custom class size to track pebbles as they are collected. Total number of pebbles is tracked and displayed along with percentile statistics which are updated for every rock added. A csv file saved in your #HOME#/Downloads folder can be created which stores tracked data.
